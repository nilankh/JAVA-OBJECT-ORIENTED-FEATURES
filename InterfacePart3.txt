Q) What are the Differences between classes, abstract classes and interfaces?

ans-> 
1)  Classes are able to allow only concrete methods.
    Abstract classes are able to allow both concrete methods and abstract methods.
    Interface are able to allow only abstract methods.

2)  To declare classes, we are able to use "class" keyword.
    To declare abstract classes, we will use "abstract" keyword.
    To declare interfaces we will use "interface" keyword.
[There are some changes in java8 and java9]

3)  For classes only, we are able to create both reference variables and objects.
    For abstract classes and interfaces we are able to declare reference variables only, we are
    unable to create objects.

4)  In case of interfaces, by default, all variables are "public static final".
    In case of classes and abstract classes, no default cases are existed for variables.

5)  In case of interfaces, by default, all methods are "public abstract".
    In cases of class and abstract class, no default cases are existed for methods.

6)  Classes are able to provide less sharability.
    Abstract classes are able to provide middle level sharability.
    Interfaces are able to provide more sharability.

7)  Classes are able to allow constructors.
    Abstract classes are able to allow constructors.
    Interfaces are unable to allow constructors.

8)  Classes are able to allow static blocks.
    Abstract classes are able to allow static blocks.
    Interfaces are not allowing static blocks.

9)  Classes are able to allow instance blocks.
    Abstract classes are able to allow instance blocks.
    Interfaces are not allowing instance blocks.
