Method signature and prototype:
-------------------------------
There are two approaches avilable to describe method information:
    1)  Method signature.
    2)  Method prototype.

Q)  What is the difference between method signature and method prototype?

ans:Method signature is a description of the method, it include method name and parameter list.
    eg: forName(String class_Name)
        add(int fval, int sval)
    here "add" is method name.
    &
    (int fval, int sval) this is parameter list.

Method prototype is method description, it includes access modifiers list, return type, method name,
parameter list, throws exception list.

eg:
public static class forName(String className) throws classNotFoundException

public int add(int fval, int sval)
